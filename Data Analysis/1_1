The DATA Analysis Process
    1.Asking proper and relevent questions to extract information that can be used further
    2.Data Wrangling/Data Munging=Cleaning Data
    3.Exploratory Data Analysis=exploring data,deriving corelations,etc
    4.Drawing conclusions
    5.Communicating results.....


<1>ASKING QUESTIONS:-
    features contributing analysis
    features not important
    features with strong corelation
    preprocessing required or not...
    manipulation/engineering required....
    
must have subject matter expertise(SME)
experience


<2>DATA WRANGLING/MUNGING
    transforming and mapping data from one raw data form to another format with the intension of making it much more appropriate for analysis.
    1.Gathering Data
        CSV,fetching from API,web scarping,Databases(using sql to analyse)
    2.Assessing Data
        finding number of rows/columns(shape)
        column's data types,check for missing values(info())
        duplicate data(is_unique)
        memory occupied by dataset(info)
        high level maths overview of data(describe)
    3.Cleaning Data
        missing data(mean,mode,median)
        removing duplicate data(drop_duplicates)
        incorrect data type(astype)
        
<3>EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
    1.Explore data
        finding corelation
        doing univariate and multivariate analysis
        visualising data by plotting graphs
    2.Augment data(FEATURE ENGINEERING)
      Removing outliers(box plots)
      merging dataframes
      adding new column
<4>DRAWING CONCLUIONS
    using machine learning algorithms
    inferential staistics
    descriptive statistics(data analysis process)

<5>COMMUNICATING RESULTS/DATA STORYTELLNG
    in person
    reports
    blog posts
    PPTs/slides deck
