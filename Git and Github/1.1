Git?
    
    wikipedia:Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
    
version control : keeping record of all the previous version of a file or program so that the changes made could be tracked and if any problem occurs then the previous form of the file or code can be retrived.this is what version control is : taking snapshots at various times so that one can go back and make changes in case of any sort of problem accordingly.
 it is basically a system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time so that specific versions can be recallled when required.
 
Benefits:
    version and source control
    bug tracking
    collaborative development
    
Github:It is a web service owned by Microsoft that provides hosting for software development version control using Git.


so basically git and github are not exactly the same thing-as git is a version control system using which one can create or track versions of one'ssoftware or file and that fie can be hosted onto the internet using the service called github.
